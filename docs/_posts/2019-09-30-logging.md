openFrameworks has an advanced logging system that can be useful for reporting and debugging your applications.

Log messages have a "severity" level:
* `OF_LOG_VERBOSE`: For extra information (TMI)
* `OF_LOG_NOTICE`: For normal reporting, like status updates, state changes, etc.
* `OF_LOG_WARNING`: For minor errors that can be ignored, like an image that is not the dimensions you expected.
* `OF_LOG_ERROR`: For major errors that should be handled, like an image that fails to load because the file does not exist.
* `OF_LOG_FATAL_ERROR`: For showstopper errors, like not finding a camera for a vision based app.
