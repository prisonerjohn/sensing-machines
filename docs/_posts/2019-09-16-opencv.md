[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) is an open-source library for performing computer vision operations.
* OpenCV was originally released in 2000 and has gone through many updates and revisions since then.
* The library is cross-platform and available for all major platforms. It includes interfaces in C++, Java, and Python.
* OpenCV includes hundreds of algorithms, for performing a variety of tasks like image conversion, object tracking, feature recognition, camera calibration, etc.

### OpenCV for openFrameworks

OpenCV uses its own image type, called [`cv::Mat`](https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.1/d3/d63/classcv_1_1Mat.html). This is similar to `ofPixels`, as it holds an array of pixel values, but it's much more powerful as you can perform all types of operations on them. For example, you can add or multiply two `cv::Mat` objects directly, without needing to loop through the pixels one at a time.

<details>
	<summary>What does the <code>::</code> mean here?</summary>
	<p markdown="1">
	We have already covered that `::` is a scope resolution operator in C++. We first encountered `::` to show the relationship between methods and classes, and here it is used to show the relationship between classes and namespaces. 
	</p>
	<p markdown="1">
	A [namespace](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/namespace) is a top-level group that holds classes that are related to each other. It is similar to a Java package. For example, `cv::Mat` is a reference to the `Mat` class that belongs to the `cv` namespace.
	</p>
	<p markdown="1">
	 Classes in the same namespace can refer to each other directly, but classes outside of that namespace need to specify the namespace using the `::` notation to refer to its classes.
	</p>
	<p markdown="1">Most classes in OF do not belong to a namespace, which is why we have not seen this yet, but this is gradually changing. New additions to the framework, like the [`glm`](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html) math library are keeping their namespace visible, so we will encounter types like `glm::vec2` and `glm::vec3` when manipulating vectors.
	</p>
</details>

While you can use the OpenCV library directly in OF (since both are written in C++), this would require image type conversions every time we would need to transfer from one framework to the other. For example, to convert our background subtraction algorithm we would:
1. Capture a frame from the camera in "OF space", using `ofVideoGrabber` and `ofPixels`.
2. Convert the `ofPixels` to a `cv::Mat` to use the pixels in "OpenCV space".
3. Perform the background subtraction using OpenCV functions.
4. Convert the result `cv::Mat` back to an `ofImage` to draw it to the screen.

This also applies to other types which we will use. For example:
* Points ([`cv::Point`](https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.1/db/d4e/classcv_1_1Point__.html) vs [`glm::vec2`](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/glm/glm%3A%3Avec2/))
* Scalars ([`cv::Vec`](https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.1/d6/dcf/classcv_1_1Vec.html) vs [`glm::vec4`](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/glm/glm%3A%3Avec4/))
* Rectangles ([`cv::Rect`](https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.1/d2/d44/classcv_1_1Rect__.html) vs [`ofRectangle`](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/types/ofRectangle/))

We will use an openFrameworks addon to interface with OpenCV. This will take care of handling these conversions and give us additional OF-specific methods we can use.

We have two options for addons:
* [`ofxOpenCv`](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/ofxOpenCv/) is the built-in OpenCV addon. This wrapper hides most of the native OpenCV structures and methods and allows us to work strictly in "OF space". While this simplifies our work, we are limited by the data types and algorithms that are included in the addon.
* [`ofxCv`](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv) is a user-contributed addon that takes a more transparent approach. Interchange between OF and CV is facilitated with helper functions, but the majority of the work is done using native OpenCV calls. While it may take a little longer to get started, it reduces our dependency to OF as we are learning how to use OpenCV directly.

We will use `ofxCv` for this class. As it is a user-contributed addon, we will need to [download](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv) it and unzip it in the OF addons directory at `/path/to/OF/addons/`. Once that is done, the Project Generator will automatically detect the addon and allow us to include it in our projects.

`ofxCv` uses the OpenCV files from the `ofxOpenCv` addon, so make sure to include both in your projects.

### OpenCV Background Subtraction

Let's convert our background subtraction example to use OpenCV. We will focus on pixel brightness for our operations, so will convert our images to grayscale before processing.

{% gist 95ad94acc37baf167c4f2f15129f737b ofApp-bgGray.h %}
{% gist 95ad94acc37baf167c4f2f15129f737b ofApp-bgGray.cpp %}

Note the use of the `ofxCv::absdiff()` and `ofxCv::threshold()` functions for processing all our pixels in a single line of code. These are wrappers for [`cv::absdiff()`](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/core/doc/operations_on_arrays.html?highlight=absdiff#absdiff) and [`cv::threshold()`](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/miscellaneous_transformations.html?highlight=threshold#threshold) allowing us to use `ofImage` objects in `cv` space. `ofxCv` handles all the necessary conversions behind the scenes.

As our apps get more complicated, we may want to skip these conversions to optimize our code and have it run faster. Let's rewrite the previous example using only `cv` objects for our CV operations. 

We will also make two additional optimizations:
1. Cache the variables used for grabber images so that they don't get reallocated every frame. We do this by adding two new variables `grabberColorMat` and `grabberGrayMat` to the `ofApp` class.
1. Only run through our algorithms when a new video frame is captured. This is an important step as the video camera will usually run at much lower framerate than the application itself. We do this by checking [`ofVideoGrabber.isFrameNew()`](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/video/ofVideoGrabber/#!show_isFrameNew) before running through our CV algorithm.

{% gist 95ad94acc37baf167c4f2f15129f737b ofApp-bgCv.h %}
{% gist 95ad94acc37baf167c4f2f15129f737b ofApp-bgCv.cpp %}

Note that we now have to perform all our operations explicitly, nothing happens automatically. We are not taking advantage of the helper functions provided by the `ofxCv` addon.

Let's rewrite this one more time, trying to find a balance between optimization and simplicity.

{% gist 95ad94acc37baf167c4f2f15129f737b ofApp-bgAlt.cpp %}

<details>
	<summary>Which approach is best?</summary>
	<p markdown="1">
		All three versions of our code are correct. That is an advantage of using openFrameworks and C++, all levels of abstraction are available to you. You should use whatever style you are comfortable writing, and more importantly reading back!

### Contour Finding

Contour finding consists of identifying regions of images matching a particular pattern. These patterns can be defined by color, size, shape, speed, etc. Contour finding can be used to follow objects or people in an image.

This operation consists of many steps:
1. Convert the pixel data to HSV space.
1. Threshold the image based on a target color and offset. We use an offset to get a color range, as it's unlikely that all pixels will be the exact color we are looking for.
1. Run the contour finding operation on the image.
1. Filter the array of contours and only keep the ones that match the requested parameters.

This is where `ofxCv` comes in very handy, as we can use the `ofxCv::ContourFinder` class to run all of this for us.

{% gist 95ad94acc37baf167c4f2f15129f737b ofApp-findContours.h %}
{% gist 95ad94acc37baf167c4f2f15129f737b ofApp-findContours.cpp %}

While this application technically works, it is hard to get the settings right. Let's modify it to make it easier to use.

- Add color picker
- Add better min/max area range
- Break out findcontours operation
- Add threshold image preview
- Add debug info on blobs


[`cv::findContours()`](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/structural_analysis_and_shape_descriptors.html?highlight=findcontours#findcontours) function.  This returns an array of contours, which are each just an array of points.
