# Overview

A programming course where we'll explore various techniques and solutions for tracking and sensing people or objects in space. Students will get familiar with the terminology and algorithms behind many sensing topics such as computer vision, depth cameras, positional tracking, coordinate mapping, machine learning, and pattern recognition.  As these subjects are explored, we will also dig into communication, and how this information can be transmitted from one tool to another, for example using OSC, Spout/Syphon, MIDI, DMX/ArtNet. The goal being to use the right tool for the job and not limit ourselves toa particular piece of software.

The first classes will consist of theory and in-class exercises covering these techniques, and remaining classes will be dedicated to a special project, which should use a combination of what we've learned to create a new work. Students will work in small groups to build this special project, but we'll review proposals, milestones, and work in progress collectively on every class, encouraging discussion and collaboration.

# Objectives

* Gain understanding of the various ways a computer system can "sense" its environment.
* Dive into the technical details to implement sensing systems.
* Become familiar with the distinct features of the languages and tools available to the programmer.
* Learn to use communication protocols to share data between different tools.
* Make cool projects.

# Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online at: [http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html](http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html)

# Accessibility

Please feel free to make suggestions to your instructor about ways in which this class could become more accessible to you.  Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212 998-4980 for further information.

# Counseling and Wellness

Your health and safety are a priority at NYU. If you experience any health or mental health issues during this course, we encourage you to utilize the support services of the 24/7 NYU Wellness Exchange [212-443-9999](tel:212-443-9999). Also, all students who may require an academic accommodation due to a qualified disability, physical or mental, please register with the Moses Center [212-998-4980](tel:212-998-4980). Please let your instructor know if you need help connecting to these resources.

# Use of Electronic Devices

Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.  Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.

# Title IX
